## Some Additional Notes for Swift Implementation

The tests for this exercise expect you to implement a couple of properties that return either a value of type `Int` or an [array][array] of type `[Int]`. Feel free to skim through the Array class documentation for useful methods that may help in your solution.

The final tests check for [immutability][immutability]. None of the properties you are tasked with writing should modify the scores of the game.

If you want some extra practice, you can implement a function that adds new scores to the game or handle empty array
